      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>jQuery is one of the (if not the) most popular JavaScript libraries for frontend development. It abstracts away a lot of the DOM manipulation required to make modern web applications. However, what is the fun of all that abstraction if you can't unabstract it all? That's where jQuery-Lite comes in. It is a stripped-down version of jQuery that I have built using vanilla JS inspired by an App Academy project. If that sounds fun, keep reading.</p>

      <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
      jQuery-Lite is built around a main function, $l (taking a cue from jQuery's ever-present dollar sign) which allows users to select elements on the page based on CSS selectors or by feeding HTML elements in directly and creates an array of them. This array is then passed into a custom-made DOMNodeCollection class, which is where the bulk of the work happens. The main functions of jQuery-Lite are all methods of DOMNodeCollection. It should be noted that most methods returns a DOMNodeCollection after changes have been made, making almost every jQuery-Lite method chainable.

      <h2>What can I do with it?</h2>
      <p>Good question. With jQuery Lite, you can manipulate the elements on this very page! If you want to try this out, go ahead and open up your browser's console.</p>
